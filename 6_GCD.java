// Aim: To find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two numbers

/*

GCD of two (or more) integers is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers â€” meaning it leaves no remainder.

- Let's take two numbers: 36 and 60
- Factors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36
- Factors of 60: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60
- Common factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
- GCD = 12 (the greatest among the common factors)

Simulated Output:
-----------------
Enter the first number: 36
Enter the second number: 60
GCD of 36 and 60 is: 12
